# Description
A client whose main purpose is to be used for functions that are originally found on the FTH control panel. It interacts with their JSON API--via the use of an authorization key--and performs billing, firewall, and server-oriented functions. This is the earliest release, and some of the functions outlined in the FTH API are incompletely/haphazardly documented. This results in some of these functions being unstable until there is improved documentation.

Some functions that can be found within the client are as follows:
  - Billing
    - test
