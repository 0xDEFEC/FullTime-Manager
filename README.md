# Description
A client to be used for functions that are originally found on the FTH control panel. It interacts with their JSON API--via the use of an authorization key--and performs billing, firewall, and server-oriented functions. This is the earliest release, and some of the functions outlined in the FTH API are incompletely documented. This results in some of these functions being unstable until there is improved documentation.
